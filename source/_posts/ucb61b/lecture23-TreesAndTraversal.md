### Rooted Tree
- Root
- Parent
- Leaf
- Siblings
- Ancestors: nodes on the path from itself to the root(include itself)
- Descendent
- Length of path: numbers of edges on the path(not nodes)
- Depth of node n: length of path from n to root
Depth of root is zero
- Height of node: Length of path from n to its deepst descendent
Height of any leaf is zero
Height of a tree = height of the root
- Subtree rooted at n: tree formed by its descendents
- Binary tree: no node has more than one children

### Tree Travesals
- Pre-order Traversal 
- Post-order Traversal
计算总内存，因为父节点的内存由子节点决定，所以要先看子节点的内存
- In-Order
Expression Parsing


- Level-Order Traversal
