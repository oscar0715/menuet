# Learn Colors

## Hue, Saturation, Brightness

1. Monochrome Colors: 
As long as the Hue value is approximately the same (red must remain red), you’ll get monochrome colors.

2. Analogous Colors:
This means picking nearby colors to the main one. 

3. Complementary Colors:
The Complementary color is the opposite of the main color. On the color wheel, it's the one in the opposite end. 

4. Neutral Tones:
Most importantly, the neutral tones defer the user's attention to the content.
Neutral tones shouldn’t compete against the main colors. In order to get neutral tones, you have to drag the Saturation to almost 0. Then, you change the Brightness to Light or Dark.

5. Contrast:
For good contrast, use opposite ends: white against black, light blue against dark blue, high brightness against low brightness.

6. Using an Image's Colors
Your surrounding is full of colors that inspire. When you look at beautiful photographs, objects or digital designs, one of the first things that you notice is how beautiful the colors are. When that happens, you should take a picture or screen capture the image, and extract the colors. From those colors, you can create a palette out of it.
Sip is a great iOS app that lets you create a palette out of an photo.

# Learn Typography
## Typography Basics
1. {% link Five Rules http://practicaltypography.com/typography-in-ten-minutes.html Five Rules %}
    - The ty­po­graphic qual­ity of your doc­u­ment is de­ter­mined largely by how the body text looks
    - point size is the size of the let­ters. In print, the most com­fort­able range for body text is 10–12 point. On the web, the range is 15–25 pix­els. Not every font ap­pears equally large at a given point size, so be pre­pared to ad­just as necessary.
    - line spac­ing is the ver­ti­cal dis­tance be­tween lines. It should be 120–145% of the point size.
    - line length is the hor­i­zon­tal width of the text block. Line length should be an av­er­age of 45–90 char­ac­ters per line (use your word-count func­tion)
    - And fi­nally, font choice. The fastest, eas­i­est, and most vis­i­ble im­prove­ment you can make to your ty­pog­ra­phy is to ig­nore the fonts that came free with your com­puter (known as sys­tem fonts) and buy a pro­fes­sional font 

2.  Body Text
Pick a font that looks good in the body text. When in doubt, pick one that is both clean and comfortable to read. San Francisco, Helvetica Neue, Open Sans, Roboto, Proxima Nova and Museo Sans are some of my favorites. They’re all available for free on Google Fonts and Typekit (with Creative Cloud account).

3. Font Size
The font size should be at least 11pt to be readable on the iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch. While that is the minimum value, the recommended size for the body text is actually 15-18pt.

4. Font Weight
At 12-18pt, use Regular. At 18-24pt, use Light, at 24-32pt, use Thin and at 32pt or more, use Ultralight. 
Use bigger texts for titles and reduce the font weight to Light, Thin or Ultra Thin. Otherwise, they would steal too much attention from the rest of the content.

5. Line Height
The line height should be between 120% to 145% of the font size.

6. 45-90 Characters Per Line
When your line is too long, the reader will have a hard time focusing. The overwhelming amount of text per line wears them off, because each jump to a new line gives excitement and that happens less when lines are too long.
那我就用45吧！

7. Serif and Sans-Serif
    -  I would definitely encourage using Serif fonts for storytelling. As they're less used in modern apps, you get a unique feel to them.
    -  The Sans typefaces are more utilitarian and neutral, used widely in most modern apps.

8. Where to find Fonts
  - {% link Google Fonts https://fonts.google.com/ Google Fonts %}: There are at least two great fonts: Open Sans and Roboto, which is used by default in modern Android phones.
  - {% link SkyFonts https://skyfonts.com/  SkyFonts %}: You can use SkyFonts for Mac to automatically synchronize to your Desktop
  - {% link Typekit https://typekit.com/fonts  Typekit %}: Great fonts that I enjoy include: Proxima Nova, Museo, Adelle Sans and Brandon Grotesque.

# Learn Animations
动画不能用文字概括，还是要在Design Code网站里看

# UI Icons

1. Obvious Icons
It is encouraged to have text next to the icon in order to bring more clarity.
Pro tip: If you don't want to always have text next to the icon, introduce it first and the next time, the icon can be without text. Once the user learns the first time, they don't need to learn it again.
2. Navigation and Tab Bar Icons
Icons used in the Nav Bar and Tab Bar should have a canvas size of 30 x 30 pt.
3. App Icon
The App Icon is used for the branding of your app. It’s the first thing that users see when they experience it.
4. Icon Grid
Apple applied a golden ratio on some of their icons. This ensures that the icons are the heroes while keeping good proportions. While this is a good rule to follow, it’s not a strict rule. Even Apple omitted it on many of their icons.
5. Icon Sets for iOS
Most of us are not icon designers. That's why it's best to find vector icon sets that we can customize. These are the ones that I recommend and that I personally use in my projects.

# UI Sounds
## Where to Use Sounds
1. Notifications
2. Positive Actions
Anything that requires a bit of effort, but that is rewarding or beneficial to the user. Some examples are Liking something, following someone, creating a task, etc. A fun animation and whimsical sound should be played for those cases.
3. Destructive Actions
In a similar fashion, the destructive actions give confirmation that something was removed. 

# Design Inspirations
A product may tire quickly, but the craftsmanship behind it will last a long time.

# Design Principles
## {% link Dieter Rams: ten principles for good design https://www.vitsoe.com/rw/about/good-design Dieter Rams: ten principles for good design %}
1. Good design is innovative
2. Good design makes a product useful
3. Good design is aesthetic
4. Good design makes a product understandable
5. Good design is unobtrusive
6. Good design is honest
7. Good design is long-lasting
8. Good design is thorough down to the last detail
9. Good design is environmentally-friendly
10. Good design is as little design as possible(Back to purity, back to simplicity)

## The Rule of Three
Steve jobs was famously obsessed about this rule, presenting every product with 3 features at most (e.g., the iPhone). There is apparently a reasoning behind this: the human brain can easily remember 3 things at once. 

## The 10,000 Hours Rule
A lot of us have small ideas and think of doing quick bucks with them. That's the wrong approach. The right approach is to dedicate yourself to a larger purpose and invest your time incrementally. 

## Jiro, Dreams of Sushi
One of my favorite documentaries is about a man who dedicated his whole life to perfecting sushi, from making the rice to hand picking every piece of ingredient.

## Sleep Is For The Strong
Vacations are overrated. Traveling is not vacation -- in fact, it's more stressful than being comfortable at home and doing nothing. I personally feel happier and more satisfied when I work, even during my travels. You should travel because you want to discover new things, not because you expect to be relaxed.
With good sleep, you can think clearly, eat properly and work without really working.
